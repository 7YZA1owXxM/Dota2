Dota2 is a .NET library designed as a plugin for [SteamKit](http://github.com/SteamRE/SteamKit). It provides a handler for the DOTA 2 game coordinator. The goal is to implement as much functionality of the client as possible.

## Getting Binaries


### Visual Studio

Dota2 is distributed as a [NuGet package](http://nuget.org/packages/dota2).

Simply install SteamKit2 and Dota2 using the package manager in Visual Studio, and NuGet will add all the required dependencies and references to your project.  
  
### Other

We additionally distribute binaries on our [releases page](https://github.com/paralin/Dota2/releases).

For more information on installing SteamKit2 and Dota2, please refer to the [Installation Guide](https://github.com/SteamRE/SteamKit/wiki/Installation) on the SteamKit wiki.


## Documentation

Documentation consists primarily of XML code documentation provided with the binaries. Please see the SteamKit documentation on how to set up a Steam client.

To use the GC handler, it's simple:

```
client = new SteamClient();
DotaGCHandler.Bootstrap(client);
dota = client.GetHandler<DotaGCHandler>();
```

You can register callbacks like any other Steam network functionality from Steamkit.
